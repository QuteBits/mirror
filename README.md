Markdown Static Live Editor

Just something I smashed together in 20 minutes. Shows a live preview of your Markdown - the way it will look like if you drop markdown.min.js on it. Really cool stuff if you want to create your own static blog. Or just a blog.

## Use:

- open index.html in the browser
- write markdown on the left side and see the live preview on the right side
